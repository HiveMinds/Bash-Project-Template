You can use this as a starting point for your Bash/shell project with:

- Unit testing
- Code Coverage (100 %)
- Pre-commit:
  - shfmt (Auto-formatter)
  - Shellcheck
- Continuous Integration (GitLab CI)

That way, you start your project in a clean, tested environment.

## Usage

The main code can be ran with:

```sh
src/main.sh
```

## Testing

Put your unit test files (with extension .bats) in folder: `/test/`

### Prerequisites

(Re)-install the required submodules with:

```sh
chmod +x install-bats-libs.sh
./install-bats-libs.sh
```

Install:

```sh
sudo gem install bats
sudo gem install bashcov
sudo apt install shfmt -y
pre-commit install
pre-commit autoupdate
```

### Pre-commit

Run pre-commit with:

```sh
pre-commit run --all
```

### Tests

Run the tests with:

```sh
bats test
```

If you want to run particular tests, you could use the `test.sh` file:

```sh
chmod +x test.sh
./test.sh
```

### Code coverage

```sh
bashcov bats test
```

## How to help

- Include bash code coverage in GitLab CI.
- Add [additional](https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html) (relevant) pre-commit hooks.
- Develop Bash documentation checks
  [here](https://github.com/TruCol/checkstyle-for-bash), and add them to this
  pre-commit.
